**CENTRAL DOGMA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY**

**F**rancis Crick introduced the term “central dogma,” though he later suggested “basic assumption” might have been a more accurate term. The central dogma was proposed during a time when molecular genetics was still in its infancy. Researchers had only fragmentary experimental results and a strong belief that the fundamental concepts were simple and consistent across all living organisms. In such a context, well-constructed theories were invaluable for clarifying problems and guiding experiments.

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the unidirectional flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein. This theory elucidates how genetic information in DNA is transcribed into RNA and then translated into proteins, which perform various functions within a cell. According to the central dogma, information cannot be transferred from protein back to nucleic acids or other proteins. The key processes involved are:

<!--[if !supportLists]-->·       <!--[endif]-->During **DNA replication**, new DNA strands are formed with one strand from the parent DNA and one newly synthesized strand, a process known as semiconservative replication.

- **Transcription**: This process transfers genetic information from DNA to RNA via the enzyme RNA polymerase. The DNA strand involved in transcription consists of a promoter, a structural gene, and a terminator. The template strand synthesizes RNA, while the coding strand does not. RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, catalyzing polymerization in the 3′ to 5′ direction. Upon reaching the terminator sequence, the enzyme releases the newly synthesized RNA, which then undergoes post-transcriptional modifications.
- **Translation**: This process converts RNA sequences into specific proteins, requiring energy provided by charged tRNA molecules. Ribosomes, composed of a larger and a smaller subunit, initiate translation. The mRNA enters the smaller subunit and is held by tRNA molecules in the larger subunit, allowing peptide bonds to form between amino acids. This process repeats, creating long polypeptide chains.

These processes can be categorized into general transfers, special transfers, and unknown transfers. General transfers, which occur in almost all cells, describe the regular flow of information through transcription and translation. Special transfers occur only under exceptional laboratory conditions, while unknown transfers are believed never to occur.

The central dogma is crucial in bioinformatics as it provides a framework for analyzing and interpreting genetic data. The integration of molecular biology with computational methods accelerates advancements in fields such as genomics, proteomics, and personalized medicine, making the central dogma not only a cornerstone of molecular biology but also a pivotal concept in bioinformatics.
